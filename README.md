## Memos for development

### Build dependencies

* make
* Sass
* Erlang/OTP
* Rebar3
* Elm
* [APBuf](https://github.com/gfngfn/apbuf)
  - Used for generating a JSON encoder/decoder from `model.apbuf`.
  - Can be intalled via OPAM pin.
* [Sesterl](https://github.com/gfngfn/Sesterl)
  - A statically-typed Erlang.
  - Can be intalled via OPAM pin.


### How to build

Just invoke `make`.


### How to run tests

Invoke `make test`.


### How to launch locally

Invoke `make run`.


### How to deploy on an EC2 instance

1. Make branch `temp-deploy` which contains the build targets generated by APBuf, Elm, and Sesterl.
   - This step shall be removed in the future; the pipeline scripts for building programs written in APBuf, Elm, and Sesterl will be needed.

2. Generate your key pair.

3. Invoke the following command to deploy on an EC2 instance (this step takes approximately 10 minutes):

   ```console
   $ cd 〈RootOfThisRepository〉
   $ aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name "〈NameOfYourStack〉" --template-file aws/cloud-formation.template.yaml --parameter-overrides "KeyName=〈NameOfYourKey〉"
   ```

4. Get the IP address assigned to the instance and visit the address by using a browser.


### Acknowledgement

* The cloudFormation template in the following repository has been largely used as a reference:
  - [thiagoesteves/erlgame: Snake Game webserver written in Erlang using cowboy as webserver. there is an aws cloud formation to deploy the game at aws amazon](https://github.com/thiagoesteves/erlgame)
